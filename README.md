# Problem Statement
### *Context* :

A chit fund has 25 members. Each month they contribute Rs 2000 each. 
End of the month, the person who bids the lowest for the corpus, gets his bid. 
The group organizer gets paid a fixed commission of Rs 2500 each month (5% of 25*2000).It is deducted from the bid winner's corpus.  The remaining amount is distributed among all the 25 customers equally.

Enclosed excel has the table with cashflows for each month.


Task :

	•	What is the Annualized  Return of the person who bids in the last month ? 
	
	•	What is the Annualized Return of the person who bids in the first month ?
	
	•	Write an R/Python script which calculates the annualized return of chit fund participant ?- Show the Return % for each month's bid winner.
 
Document your assumptions.

**Note**: Please google about how chitfund works, incase if you are not familiar with the mechanism!
